## TODO
- [x] Add commas for numbers in thousands
- [x] Combine the 2 results tables into 1
- [x] Hide results table on load, show it on click
- [ ] Figure out a non hacky way to load results instead of using setTimeout
- [ ] If any of the 9 pics returned is less than x hours old, discard it until you have 9 results that are > x hours old
- [x] Store results and save them so they can be compared to future results
- [x] Grey out submit button on results, otherwise hitting it again will double feed results
- [ ] Need to figure out a way to have the username box send a SQL query to the DB via historydisplay.php
